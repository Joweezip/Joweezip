〰️Hi! 👋 , my name is Joel Cardenas, i am a Jr Frontend Developer who is passionate about 4 things: Cars, Interior Design, Technology and coffee. 

〰️A few words about me:
I start coding at 12 but i dont really enjoy do it so i leave it saying that it waa too hard for me ( at least i learn the basics),
a few years later at 16 i start coding, i was curious and after a few months it wanst that hard anymore and i was really enjoying 
coding and all that stuff. Now i am a little jr Frontend developer who is trying to become a fullstack developer some day.
